                <p> One main technology that determined by the shape of our planet is GPS (Global Positioning System) <br>
                <p>If the mass of material that we live on were a flat plane, we would only need a few sattelites to provide full coverage.<br>
                   <p> Due to the spherical shape of our planet, signals get interfered at certain points due to the curve of the planet. Signals are sent 
                    in straight lines and cannot go far through physical material. Due to this, we need at least 24 sattelites to send flat earth propoganda worldwide.
