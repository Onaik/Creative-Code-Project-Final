                <p>Another basic observation that would call for a huge conspiracy is airplane routes. If the earth were a flat disk, the routes we take would be drastically different.

                <p>With a sphere, we can travel in multiple directions to arrive at the same place. On a disk, if we wanted to travel from South America to Asia, we would have to fly across the north pole<br>

       <p>  If we got a flat map and we translated the current travel routes, they would be impractical for a disk.<br> This would mean that
         we are adding hours to peoples commutes 
        for the sake of this, <br>and all commercial airplane pilots are aware of the actual shape of the planet and have been able to keep it a secret.
