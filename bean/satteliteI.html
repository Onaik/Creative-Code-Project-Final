                <p> The truth is we would not be able to have such advanced technology if only a select few people knew the shape of the planet. So much that we rely on is made for a round planet.</p>
                <p> One main technology that is determined by the shape of our planet is GPS (Global Positioning System) <br>
                <p>If the mass of material that we live on were a flat plane, we would only need a few sattelites to provide full coverage.<br>
                   <p> However, because of the spherical shape of our planet, signals get interfered at certain points due to the curve of the planet. Signals are sent 
                    in straight lines and cannot go far through physical material. For basic coverage, we need at least 24 sattelites to send flat earth propoganda worldwide.
<p> 
     We are in an ironic sitaution where a main reason this flat earth propoganda has gotten so popular is because of technologies that are built according to a spherical planet.
     <p> There are groups of people who desire esoteric knowledge to the extent that they will lie to themselves and negate the truth </p>
